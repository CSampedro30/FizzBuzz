# FizzBuzz

This repository contains several ways to make FizzBuzz exercise in different programming languages (Java, JavaScript or Kotlin).

I've made 2 differents ways to do that in Java and JavaScript, i did implement a STDIN to read command lines.

And I made one with HTML and CSS languages for fun.
